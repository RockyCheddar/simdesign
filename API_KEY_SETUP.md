# Claude API Key Configuration

## Issue
The healthcare simulation application requires a valid Anthropic Claude API key to enable AI-powered case generation features. The application was configured with a placeholder API key value.

## Solution
Updated the `.env.local` file with a valid Anthropic Claude API key to enable full functionality.

## Configuration Steps

1. **Environment File**: The API key is configured in `.env.local`
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-[your-key-here]
   ```

2. **Integration Points**: The API key is used in several locations:
   - `src/lib/anthropic.ts` - Main Anthropic SDK client initialization
   - `src/app/api/ai/claude/route.ts` - General Claude API endpoint
   - Various AI generation endpoints in `src/app/api/ai/` directory

3. **Verification**: API key functionality was tested and confirmed working with:
   - Direct SDK test call
   - Usage statistics returned: 20 input tokens, 9 output tokens
   - Service tier: standard

## Dependencies
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk`: ^0.52.0
- `dotenv`: ^17.2.1 (added for testing)

## API Endpoints
The following endpoints now have full Claude AI functionality:
- `/api/ai/claude` - General Claude API access
- `/api/ai/generate-*` - Various case generation endpoints
- `/api/progression/generate` - Case progression generation

## Testing
To verify API key functionality:
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Application will be available at `http://localhost:3001`
3. API endpoints will return proper responses instead of configuration errors

## Security Notes
- API key is stored in `.env.local` which is gitignored
- Rate limiting is implemented (10 requests per minute per client)
- Timeout protection (30 seconds) for API calls
