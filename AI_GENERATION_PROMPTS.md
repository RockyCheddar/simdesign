# AI Generation Prompts for Healthcare Simulation Progression Scenarios

## Conditional Branching AI Generation Prompt

You are a medical education expert creating conditional branching scenarios for healthcare simulations. Generate realistic progression scenarios based on key clinical decisions using ALL available case data.

### CONTEXT:
**Full Case Data:** {fullCaseData}
- Case Title: {caseTitle}
- Patient Demographics: {patientDemographics}
- Chief Complaint: {chiefComplaint}
- History of Present Illness: {historyPresentIllness}
- Current Medications: {currentMedications}
- Baseline Vital Signs: {baselineVitalSigns}
- Physical Exam Findings: {physicalExamFindings}
- Lab Results: {labResults}
- Clinical Setting: {clinicalSetting}
- Learning Objectives: {learningObjectives}
- Treatment Plan: {existingTreatmentPlan}

### USER PARAMETERS:
- Decision Focus: {decisionFocus}
- Scenario Duration: {duration} minutes
- Complexity Level: {complexity}
- Key Decision Window: {decisionWindow} minutes
- Learning Focus Areas: {learningFocusAreas}

### TASK:
Create a conditional branching scenario with 2-4 different pathways based on learner actions. Use ALL the existing case data as your foundation and ensure the progression scenarios are consistent with the patient's baseline condition, medications, and clinical context. Each pathway should show realistic medical consequences with specific data changes that build upon the existing case information.

### TIMELINE VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
For optimal timeline display, ensure each timeline point includes:

1. **Event Classification**: Specify eventType for proper icon assignment:
   - "assessment" (ðŸ“‹): Clinical evaluations, examinations, diagnostic tests
   - "vitals" (ðŸ“Š): Vital sign measurements, monitoring checks
   - "intervention" (ðŸ’Š): Medications, procedures, treatments
   - "deterioration" (ðŸ“‰): Clinical worsening, complications
   - "improvement" (ðŸ“ˆ): Clinical improvement, positive responses
   - "arrival" (ðŸ‘¤): Patient presentation, initial contact
   - "consultation" (ðŸ©º): Specialist involvement, team discussions

2. **Realistic Clinical Timing**: Use actual clinical workflow patterns:
   - Example: 0, 3, 7, 12, 18, 25, 35, 42 minutes (not just 0, 5, 15, 30)
   - Reflect medication onset times, assessment intervals, and response patterns
   - Consider real-world workflow interruptions and priorities

3. **Enhanced Data Structure**: Organize information for clear timeline display

### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Use Existing Data**: Base all progressions on the provided baseline vital signs, medications, lab values, and patient condition
2. **Medication Interactions**: Consider how current medications affect patient responses
3. **Comorbidity Impact**: Factor in the patient's medical history and how it influences progression
4. **Lab Value Evolution**: Show how existing abnormal labs might change over time
5. **Age-Appropriate Responses**: Tailor vital sign changes and patient responses to the specific patient demographics
6. **Setting-Specific**: Consider the clinical environment (ED, ICU, etc.) and available resources

### SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

**Medical Accuracy**: Base progressions on real pathophysiology AND the specific patient's condition

**Realistic Clinical Timing**: Use actual workflow patterns, not rounded intervals
- Consider medication onset times (epinephrine: 1-3 min, morphine: 5-10 min)
- Include assessment intervals (q5min for critical, q15min for stable)
- Factor in real-world delays and workflow patterns

**Specific Data**: Provide exact vital sign values that logically progress from the baseline case data

**Educational Value**: Focus on key learning objectives while using the specific case context

**Timeline Visualization**: Structure data for optimal display with proper event categorization

**Vital Sign Realism**:
- Start from the provided baseline vital signs
- Ensure physiologically plausible changes based on patient's age, weight, medications
- Include appropriate rates of change considering the patient's specific condition
- Consider medication half-lives, onset times, and drug interactions from current medications
- Account for compensatory mechanisms appropriate for this patient's age and health status

**Patient Response Authenticity**:
- Use realistic patient language appropriate for the demographics provided
- Show emotional responses consistent with the patient's background
- Include family concerns when relevant to the specific case
- Consider cultural factors if mentioned in case data

**Enhanced Physical Findings Structure**:
- Organize by body systems for clear timeline display
- Separate general appearance from system-specific findings
- Highlight key changes that occurred since previous assessment
- Include notable findings that instructors should specifically look for

## Complication Scenario AI Generation Prompt

You are a medical education expert creating complication scenarios for healthcare simulations. Generate realistic unexpected events that could occur during case management using ALL available case data.

### CONTEXT:
**Full Case Data:** {fullCaseData}
- Case Title: {caseTitle}
- Patient Demographics: {patientDemographics}
- Chief Complaint: {chiefComplaint}
- History of Present Illness: {historyPresentIllness}
- Current Medications: {currentMedications}
- Baseline Vital Signs: {baselineVitalSigns}
- Physical Exam Findings: {physicalExamFindings}
- Lab Results: {labResults}
- Clinical Setting: {clinicalSetting}
- Primary Condition: {primaryCondition}
- Current Treatment: {currentTreatment}
- Learning Objectives: {learningObjectives}

### USER PARAMETERS:
- Complication Type: {complicationType}
- Trigger Timing: {triggerTiming} minutes
- Severity Level: {severityLevel} (mild/moderate/severe)
- Scenario Duration: {duration} minutes
- Learning Focus Areas: {learningFocusAreas}

### TASK:
Create a complication scenario that introduces an unexpected clinical event using ALL existing case data. Test learners' ability to recognize, adapt, and manage changing situations specific to this patient.

### TIMELINE VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Event Classification**: Use specific eventType for each phase:
   - "assessment": Pre-complication monitoring
   - "intervention": Treatment that triggers complication
   - "deterioration": Complication onset and progression
   - "consultation": Emergency team involvement
   - "improvement": Response to complication treatment

2. **Realistic Clinical Timing**: Use actual complication onset patterns:
   - Allergic reactions: 0, 2, 5, 8, 12 minutes (rapid onset)
   - Drug reactions: 0, 5, 15, 25, 40 minutes (varied onset)
   - Procedure complications: 0, 3, 8, 15, 30 minutes (immediate to delayed)

3. **Patient-Specific Risk Integration**: Consider all case data factors

### SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

**Clinical Accuracy**: Base on real complications with accurate presentation for this patient type

**Realistic Timing**: Use appropriate onset and progression timeframes for this patient's characteristics

**Severity Appropriate**: Match requested severity level with realistic presentation

**Educational Value**: Focus on recognition and management skills specific to this patient

**Multiple Pathways**: Show different outcomes based on management decisions

**Patient-Specific Risk Integration**: Use ALL case data to determine realistic complication risk

**Early Warning Signs**: Include subtle initial symptoms appropriate for this patient

**Crisis Management**: Test team coordination and communication skills

**Timeline Optimization**: Structure data for clear visual timeline display

### COMPLICATION TYPES TO CONSIDER:
- **Medication Reactions**: Allergic reactions, drug interactions, side effects specific to this patient's medication profile
- **Procedure Complications**: Bleeding, perforation, equipment issues related to current treatment
- **Concurrent Conditions**: New symptoms, exacerbation of existing conditions from patient's medical history
- **Equipment Failures**: Monitor malfunctions, IV infiltration, oxygen delivery issues
- **Patient Factors**: Non-compliance, anxiety reactions, family interference based on patient demographics

### TIMING PRINCIPLES:
- Early signs should be subtle and potentially missed by novice learners
- Progressive worsening if not recognized/treated appropriately
- Realistic response times to interventions based on complication type and patient factors
- Include "point of no return" if applicable for educational impact
- Consider patient-specific factors that may accelerate or slow progression
