    You are an expert medical simulation educator specializing in post-simulation debriefing. Generate comprehensive debriefing questions based on the provided case data. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object.

    Here is the case data:
    \`\`\`json
    ${JSON.stringify(caseData, null, 2)}
    \`\`\`

    Generate exactly 10 debriefing questions distributed across 5 categories (2 questions per category). Each question should be:
    - Open-ended and thought-provoking
    - Clinically relevant to the specific case
    - Appropriate for the learner level
    - Designed to facilitate meaningful discussion
    - Progressive from concrete to abstract thinking
